#Basic file structure for Eleventy projects

This file structure and configuration is geared towards small, simple projects that are also hosted through github pages.

- Build folder is named docs and there is a .nojekyll file so projects can be set up through github pages with minimal configuration.
- Also included is an CNAME file for when it's needed.

##Install
Clone the repository and run `npm install`.

Then run `eleventy` to check for any errors in the installation.
